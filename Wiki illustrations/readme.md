Instrument to measure the capacity of a Li-ion battery.

An arduino control a resistive load that discharges the battery.
The battery voltage is measured and logged alla along the discharge process.
The resistive load is disconnected when the battery voltgae reach a low threshold (typically 3.0V).
The voltage log can be cut/past from serial monitor to Excel to process it (plot curves, compute capacity in mA x h)
